# Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression

A machine learning implementation for binary classification of breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using logistic regression.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for medical binary classification. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from Kaggle, I built and evaluated a logistic regression model to assist in cancer diagnosis classification.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills & Technologies

### Data Manipulation & Analysis
- **Pandas** for data loading, cleaning, and exploratory analysis
- **NumPy** for numerical operations and array manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing including Label Encoding and Feature Scaling

### Machine Learning & Modeling
- **Logistic Regression** implementation using Scikit-learn
- **Feature Scaling** with StandardScaler for model optimization
- **Model Evaluation** with confusion matrices

### Development Environment
- **Python 3.12** with scientific computing stack

## 📈 Key Achievements

- Implemented end-to-end ML pipeline from data acquisition to model deployment
